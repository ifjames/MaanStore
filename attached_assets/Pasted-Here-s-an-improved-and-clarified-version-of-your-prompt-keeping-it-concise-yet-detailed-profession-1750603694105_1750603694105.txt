Here's an improved and clarified version of your prompt, keeping it concise yet detailed, professional, and structured for better understanding by developers or AI tools. The revised prompt avoids ambiguity, organizes requirements clearly, and incorporates best practices for web development:

Enhanced Prompt for Web Application Development

Create a modern, mobile-compatible web application with the following features and improvements:

Login Page Design:
Position the logo and store name title on the left side of the login form, ensuring a clean and balanced layout.
Fix the login issue where the credentials admin/admin123 result in an "invalid credentials" error. Ensure these credentials work correctly or provide a default admin account with clear documentation.
Implement smooth, modern animations (e.g., fade-in for the form, subtle hover effects on buttons) for a polished user experience.
Ensure the login page is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices, with proper alignment and touch-friendly inputs.
Inventory Management Logging:
Add detailed logging functionality to track user actions, including:
Adding a new item to the inventory.
Updating an existing item’s details (e.g., name, price, or stock quantity).
Logs should include timestamps, user details, and the specific action performed, stored securely in a database or file.
Provide an admin-accessible interface to view these logs (optional but recommended).
Price Checker Page:
Develop a chatbot-like price checker page where users can input a quantity and item name (e.g., "5 nova") to receive the total price instantly.
Example interaction: User types "5 nova" → System responds with "5 Nova units cost $X.XX" (based on the item’s price in the database).
Ensure the interface is intuitive, with real-time feedback and a conversational design (e.g., chat bubbles or a clean input/response layout).
Support error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., unknown item names or quantities).
General Requirements:
Use modern animations (e.g., CSS transitions, JavaScript libraries like GSAP) for smooth interactions, such as button clicks, form submissions, and page transitions.
Ensure the entire application is fully responsive and mobile-compatible, with a focus on usability across devices (e.g., desktops, tablets, smartphones).
Optimize performance for fast loading times and minimal lag.
Follow best practices for security, including input validation, secure password handling, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
Provide a clean, modern UI/UX with a consistent color scheme, typography, and intuitive navigation.
