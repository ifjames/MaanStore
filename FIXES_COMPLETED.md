# Session and Logout Fixes - Test Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Session Persistence Issue âœ…
**Problem**: Server showed "Active sessions: 0" even when sessionId was sent, causing 401 errors after login.

**Root Cause**: `activeSessions` Map was declared inside the `registerRoutes` function, so it was reset every time the function was called.

**Solution**: Moved `activeSessions` Map outside the function scope to global level in `/server/routes.ts`.

**Result**: Sessions now persist properly across requests. Server logs show active sessions maintained after login.

### 2. Logout Navigation Issue âœ…
**Problem**: After logout, user stayed on current page but was no longer authenticated, leading to 404/Not Found errors.

**Root Cause**: Logout only cleared session but didn't redirect to login page.

**Solutions**:
- Updated `useLogout()` in `/client/src/lib/auth.ts` to force redirect to login page using `window.location.href = "/"` 
- Updated App.tsx routing to handle unauthenticated users by redirecting all routes to Login component
- Removed catch-all NotFound route for unauthenticated users

**Result**: After logout, user is now always redirected to login page regardless of which page they were on.

### 3. Dashboard Number Formatting âœ…
**Problem**: Large numbers in dashboard stats cards could overflow and break layout.

**Solution**: 
- Created `/client/src/lib/format.ts` with compact number formatting functions
- Updated dashboard to use `formatCompactNumber()` and `formatCurrency()` 
- Improved stats card responsive text sizing and truncation

**Result**: Numbers now display as compact format (e.g., â‚±729.1K, 1.2M) and never overflow cards.

### 4. Debug Logging Cleanup âœ…
**Problem**: Excessive debug logging in production.

**Solution**: Removed most console.log statements from auth middleware and session management.

**Result**: Cleaner production logs while maintaining essential functionality.

## Test Steps to Verify:

1. **Session Persistence**:
   - Login with admin/admin123
   - Navigate between pages (Dashboard, Inventory, Categories)
   - Refresh browser
   - Sessions should persist without 401 errors

2. **Logout Navigation**:
   - Login and navigate to any page (e.g., /inventory, /categories)
   - Click logout from sidebar
   - Should redirect to login page, not 404

3. **Dashboard Formatting**:
   - View dashboard stats cards
   - Large numbers should display in compact format
   - Text should not overflow cards on mobile
